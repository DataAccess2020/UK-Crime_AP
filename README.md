## **Research question** :round_pushpin:

How COVID-19 has influenced the types of crime in England. Did the lockdown enable the increase of domestic violence? How did the frequency of the various types of crime change since the pandemic started?

## **Dataset** üóÑ

The data are downloaded from the UK Crime Open Data <https://data.police.uk>, it contains data regarding all types of crime from March 2019 to March 2021. The dataset is divided into the following districts of England: - Avon and Somerset Constabulary; - Bedfordshire Police; - Cambridgeshire Constabulary; - Cheshire Constabulary; - City of London Police; - Cleveland Police; - Cumbria Constabulary; - Derbyshire Constabulary; - Devon & Cornwall Police; - Dorset Police; - Durham Constabulary; - Essex Police; - Gloucestershire Constabulary; - Greater Manchester Police; - Hampshire Constabulary; - Hertfordshire Constabulary; - Humberside Police; - Kent Police; - Lancashire Constabulary; - Leicestershire Police; - Lincolnshire Police; - Merseyside Police; - Service Norfolk Constabulary; - North Yorkshire Police; - Northamptonshire Police; - Northumbria Police; - Nottinghamshire Police; - South Yorkshire Police; - Staffordshire Police; - Suffolk Constabulary; - Surrey Police; - Sussex Police; - Thames Valley Police; - Warwickshire Police; - West Mercia Police; - West Midlands Police; - West Yorkshire Police; - Wiltshire Police.

The variables of interest are the ones regarding the date and month of the happening, the type of crime and the district that reported the crime. Additionally, I will look in depth the crimes regarding domestic violence and abuse.

## **Analysis** :chart_with_upwards_trend:

First, I will do an analysis on the crimes reported before the pandemic, from March 2019 to March 2020, then, I'll compare the results with the crimes reported after the pandemic and the lockdown, from March 2020 to March 2021. Doing so, I'm analyzing the 12 months that anticipate the lockdown and the 12 following months, revealing possible changes in the types of crime committed and their frequency. I will also focus my analysis on how domestic violence changed before and after the 2020 lockdown.

## **Expected results** üñá

I think that reports for abuse and domestic violence increased during and since the lockdown, I also expect to see a shift in the types of crime committed in the various areas of England caused by specific characteristics of the district
